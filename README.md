Reflection:

This was harder than I thought it would be, all told. Coming up with a unique data story was difficult for me because I wanted it to be really meaningful and for the results to be surprising, but in the end, time got away from me and I had to just go with something. I had also hoped to use scraped data from the Living Wage Calculator, but ultimately I began to distrust their calculations so I ended up using my own not as good calculations instead. I also wish I had annotated my maps more, but alas.

Unfortunately, I’m not sure that I learned anything brand, brand new, but I did remind myself of some rmarkdown settings and how the brewer package works. Upon further reflection, actually, references were brand new to me! 

Going forward, I would like to stick with this data “problem” about best places to remote work, but I would like to come up with a better metric for determining that. It would also be great to examine each region of the US for the highest paying metro area and to throw a commuting distance metric in there, too.
